Files for the Coursera Data Products project
This repo contains the files needed to run the shiny project submitted by maander6 for the Coursera Data Products course.  The ui.R, server.R, and the needed R-functions are included in the app3 subdirectory.

The fitdaily.R and fitdata.R function files have had the username and password editted out of the files posted to Github for security.  When the shiny app (found at https://maander6.shinyapps.io.app3) is run, these files will scrape data from the fitbit.com web-site from the web-app author's data (to illustrate the app).  It would be relatively simple to create a log-in function so that others could view their information.  I decided not to add this functionality because I wanted to be sure that all possible evaluators would be able to see the shiny app work with real, up-to-date data.
